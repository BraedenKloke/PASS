Time Travel Analysis

Eren, a famous scientist in Japan, is obsessed with time travel and has come
really close to a machine that makes it reality.

Eren has associated and error score with his experiments - lower is better.
Depending on his use of magic (0 - 2.11), Eren finds the following Error scores:

Magic Usage: [0.12, 0.3, 0.61, 0.77, 0.97, 1.08, 1.35, 1.56, 1.75, 2.11]
Error Score: [-0.29, -0.6, -0.67, -1.34, -1.0, -0.89, 0.57, 2.1, 4.75, 7.94]

How much magic should eren use to minimize error?

a) Find a cubic regression for the data above
b) Plot the cubic along with a scatter plot
c) How much magic is used for an error of -0.5?
d) How much magic should be used to minimize the error?
