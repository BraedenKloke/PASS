Week: 2
Activity: 3

This Python code was designed for a "ECOR 1042: Data Management" PASS workshop.

Core concepts covered include:
* 2D matrices


Activity: Model a Checker Board in Python
-----------------------------------------
Design a function that returns an 8 x 8 checker board with black and red squares.

Requirements:
* The checker board will be represented as a 2D array of 64 squares.
* Use "B" for black and "R" for red.
* The top leftmost square should be black.
* The final version must use for loops. (How many will be needed?)


Incremental Development Checklist:
1) [ ] Can you get this function to return an empty array?
2) [ ] Can you get this function to return an empty 2D array?
3) [ ] Without a for loop, can you get this function to return the correct checkerboard?
4) [ ] With a for loop, can you get this function to return a checkerboard
with only black squares?
5) [ ] With 2 for loops, can you get this function to return an 8x8 checkerboard
with black and red squares?

CHALLENGE: Can you code this using a while loop?
