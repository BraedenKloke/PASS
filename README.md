# PASS
Activities, coding problems and mock exams for [Peer Assisted Study Sessions](https://carleton.ca/csas/pass/) at Carleton University.

As a PASS facilitator, I design weekly workshops and mock exams that review core concepts presented in class. Our role is not to re-lecture, but instead encourage students to particpate, collaborate together and foster independent learning.

I've created this GitHub repository as a means to publicly document my work, but also provide the oppurtinity for students to "get their feet wet" using GitHub. The use of GitHub is not mandatory to attend PASS.
