# Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS)
> Activities, coding problems and mock exams for [Peer Assisted Study Sessions](https://carleton.ca/csas/pass/) at Carleton University.

> As PASS facilitators, we design weekly workshops and mock exams that review core concepts presented in class. Our role is not to re-lecture, but instead encourage students to particpate, collaborate together and foster independent learning. 

> This GitHub repository is a means to publicly document our work, but also provide the oppurtinity for students to "get their feet wet" using the GitHub platform. The use of GitHub is not mandatory to attend PASS.

> The hope is that this repository is continued and built upon for years to come by future PASS facilitators and students.
